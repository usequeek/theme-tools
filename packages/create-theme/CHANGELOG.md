# @usequeek/create-theme

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- A theme never imports Next.js. `theme/core-boundary` now rejects any import of `next` or `next/*` (static, side-effect, dynamic or `require`): link and navigate with `import { Link, useRouter, usePathname } from '@usequeek/theme-kit/navigation'` (theme-kit 0.1.10). Which framework runs the storefront is Queek's to change; a theme written against the kit keeps working when it does. The starter uses the kit's navigation and needs `@usequeek/theme-kit` 0.1.10 or later.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- The starter's hero button shows its label (a link rule outranked the button's colour), and the starter points you at `npm run check`. `queek-theme dev` no longer shows Next's corner badge over your theme.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- `npm create @usequeek/theme` is a guided setup: the theme's name, its templates (businesses picked from the platform's list, and which is primary), categories, tags, extra pages and AI assistants, each also a flag (`--name`, `--templates`, `--primary`, `--categories`, `--tags`, `--pages`, `--ai`/`--no-ai`, `--yes`, `--dry-run`, `--force`, `--pm`). It renames the skeleton for you, writes one demo store per template, and keeps AGENTS.md plus the files for the assistants you chose. `queek-theme init` takes the same flags. New rule `theme/placeholder-content`: the starter's placeholder products and photos, and its placeholder theme description, never ship.
